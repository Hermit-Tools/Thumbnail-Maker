# Hermit Tools/Thumbnail Maker
Minecraft is the best-selling game on Earth. Hermitcraft is one of the most popular Minecraft whitelisted server. 24 famous YouTubers play Minecraft together on the server. They have all sorts of fun. They record their stuff and share it with us on their respective channels.  
Hermit Tools is an open source GitHub organisation which aims to provide the Hermits with helpful tools. This repository is directed towards making each and every Hermit an automated thumbnail maker webpage. We will start with one of them and slowly, but flawlessly, cover all of them. We recommend checking the wiki for more information.
